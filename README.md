# HangManC
Final Project for CSC250 at DSU

This is a Hang Man game utilizing pointers, CLI Arguments, 2D arrays, customer head files, file input, pass by reference and strings.

The program should read the given file to create a word list and then select a word at random that will be used for the game. 

It is currently fully working but could use some improvements, I'm sure.
